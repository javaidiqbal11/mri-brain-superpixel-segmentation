These are the following steps performed to compute the proposed model:
1-Read file "Train_Module_All.m" and save all trained slices in specific file name with .mat extention
2-Read file "class_balancing.m" and set the specific file file which you wants to balance.
3-Read file "Test_Module_All.m" and compute the specific volume. 


Note*
	The dataset which we used are MICCAI BRATS-2017 Training for HGG and LGG volumes
